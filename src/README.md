Models that were picked:
- Random Forest: Can handle nonlinearity, intergrates feature importances. Good for accuracy and stability.
- Linear Regression: good baseline model, checks for linear relationships.
- Decision Tree: Uses tree type algorithm, can work with raw data, and handle large dataset.
- SVM: tunable based on kernel
- XGBoost: Can iterate over to get the best solution
