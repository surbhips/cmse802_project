DMA-FTIR creep-recovery study of a poly(ester urethane) elastomer with molecular-level viscoelstic modeling
    - both DMA and FTIR spectra demonstrate the deformation and used to understand viscoelastic behvaior characterized by measuring stress and strain

Utilization of synthetic Near-infrared Spectra via generative adversarial network to improve wood stiffness prediction
    - NIR spectra was calculated to predict modulus of elasticity.
    - Used GAN because of the small sample size to generate synthetic NIR spectra
    - original and enhanced datasets used to train ANN, CNN, and light gradient boosting machines for the prediction
    - increasing hidden layers and neurons resulted in overfitting of data

Photo-Rheology and FTIR Cure analysis of photopolymer resins for additive manufacturing
    - FTIR offers insights into chemical transformations, tracking the consumption of reactive groups and evolution of cross-linking over time
    - gel point is the stage of curing process where the material transitions from liquid to solid and it is indicated by crossover of the storage and loss modulus.
    - cure point - where the material has fully solidified
    - FTIR explains the chemical changes that occur during curing process
    - understanding the relationship between modulus and conversion is used for 3d printing to optimize the properties like print intensity
    - ATR for spectral data and UV-vis
    - overlay showed that 50% conversion after which any more did not effect the modulus
    - measuring the slope of modulus increase at curing provides comparison of the concentration of PI in the system
    - at low conc. the cure time increases
    - at high conc the PI has an asymptotic relationship because of the radical self-termination and initiation
    - higher concentration: more radicals, higher conversion with shorter chains, and more corsslinked matrix

Crosslinking relationships
    - as crosslinking increases the storage modulus increases
    - as crosslinking increases the loss modulus decreases, the network becomes more rigid and less viscous
    - loss modulus: dissipated energy during deformation
    - storage modulus: material's ability to store energy elasticically during deformation, indicating stiffness and resistance to deformation
    - as crosslinking increases the decrease in tan delta peak height and broadening of peak, this indicated more elastic and less dissipative materials
